# rafter-runtime

Persist-before-output runtime wrapper for the Rafter core.

`rafter-runtime` wraps `rafter::Node` with hard-state, log, and snapshot
persistence. It withholds peer and application outputs until required durable
work has completed, and it supports batched `step_batch` calls for group
commit.

Use this crate when an embedding needs a durable node but still wants to own
its application state machine, transport, scheduling, recovery policy, and
authorization boundary.

Pair it with `rafter-storage` for file-backed or in-memory stores.

On restart, feed runtime recovery outputs through the application layer only
after matching them against the application's durable applied floor. Application
state durability remains the caller's responsibility above this runtime.
